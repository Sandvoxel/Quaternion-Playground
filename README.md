# Quaternion
This project is what I used to understand Quaternion rotation and its relation to angular momentum. This simulation is a simulation of how rotation is affected by angular momentum and the distribution of mass in an object. The implemtaion is what I came up with during my two months of research on the topic. A greae deal of info on the subject was found in this [paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~baraff/sigcourse/notesd1.pdf) as well as the book [Rigid Body Dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Rigid-Body-Dynamics-Beginners-Quaternions/dp/1493598201/ref=asc_df_1493598201/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312038790168&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4000854096015418578&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012940&hvtargid=pla-448999463670&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=62820904035&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312038790168&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4000854096015418578&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012940&hvtargid=pla-448999463670) by Phil Kim.

## Setup
Open project directroy as a gradle project and refresh gradle

## Usage
Use W to apply thrust at the tip of the red line <br>
Use S to reset the Object <br>
Use A and D to change the Vector Left and right <br>
Use Space to apply  a spin to the Object <br>
